            "Generated Summary: A movie producer and screenwriter discuss plans for a three-hour John Wick movie. The movie includes a new villain called the marquee, who seeks to destroy the New York Continental, and an old friend of John's called Kane, to be played by Donnie Yen. A new character, Tracker, with an attack dog, is also going to be introduced. While mathematically speaking there will be less dogs than Halle Berry's character, the producer and screenwriter continue to promote the project. John Wick is on the run and traveling from country to country with the help of Off-Screen Airlines to try and kill people and claim the massive bounty on his head. He plans to save his own skin by challenging someone to a duel on behalf of a crime family, but saves himself by killing the marquee on a technicality. Eventually John wants Winston to bring his body home, implying he dies, unless the story shakes things up. A person is expressing their gratitude to someone for taking the time to not do something that they feel obligated to do, despite the anxiety it may cause.\n"
